# Scrapify

### Web scraping app featuring
1. Node.js
2. Request
3. Cheerio

This app scrapes the first 5 pages of reviews for
McKaig Chevrolet Buick to determine the overly positive endorsements. 

My critera for overly positive endorsements are those in which the length
of the review was considerably shorter than the standard reviews. 

To run this application, simply run yarn, or npm i inside the terminal.

to see the top 3 offenders, run node index.js inside the terminal, and it will console.log the them to the terminal.
